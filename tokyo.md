# Tokyo MariaDB updates

In July, I visited Tokyo and it was a hotbed of technology (especially around databases). The yearly event, [dbtechshowcase 2016](http://www.db-tech-showcase.com/tokyo_2016_jp) was held at the Akihabara UDX and there were a huge amount of talks. I focused on a talk that I've only ever given twice before this, [Lessons from database failures](http://www.slideshare.net/bytebot/lessons-from-database-failures). It was well received by the audience.

Towards the end, there was some discussion about what I didn't get to talk about - many InfiniDB users are interested in [MariaDB ColumnStore](https://mariadb.com/products/mariadb-columnstore). So I talked about it in the hallway track and encouraged people to show up to the Tokyo MariaDB User Group Meetup.

A few days later we had the [Tokyo MariaDB User Group Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Tokyo-MariaDB-Community-Event/events/232384187/), organised by Spiral Arms, hosted at All About Corp. As for site invites, it was split into 3 sites, since the other two are Japanese focused and where most people signed up. We were greeted by a [Pepper robot](https://www.ald.softbankrobotics.com/en/cool-robots/pepper) at the office.

I focused on [MariaDB 10.1: What's new and what's coming in 10.2](http://www.slideshare.net/bytebot/mariadb-101-whats-new-and-whats-coming-in-102-tokyo-mariadb-meetup) and I was happy to note that many are using MariaDB Server 10.0 and 10.1 already. Encryption has been a key for many. There was also a talk on groonga/mroonga, and we realised that the versions shipping inside of MariaDB Server are quite dated - there has to be a goal to ensure that the developers can commit directly (but first, they also have to ensure that mroonga builds on all platforms that we support, e.g. [OpenBSD](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-7209) and [FreeBSD](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-9229)). Of course it was wonderful to hear about the SPIDER roadmap and what's planned, considering more users of this engine these days.

The last talk was focused on MariaDB ColumnStore, which Kentoku gave in Japanese. This had lots of Q&A, and I think the most important bit is that the source is available on [github](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/mariadb-columnstore-server). There were also questions around why some things were stored on github.com/mariadb-corporation and github.com/mariadb, and the clear explanation there was on ownership -- so we did talk about the [trademark](https://mariadb.org/about/trademark/) document. After that it was free for all sushi, beer and some other snacks so people could cheers and talk for about an hour plus. 

All in, good two talks in Tokyo, and its clear that there are people very into databases there.
